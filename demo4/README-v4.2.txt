What users see as "balloon" is actually:

‚úÖ Yellow background (#ffffe1) - authentic office assistant colors
‚úÖ Black border (2px) - professional appearance  
‚úÖ Rounded corners - speech bubble effect
‚úÖ "Ik denk na... ü§î" loading message - proper user feedback

This is the CORRECT Clippy behavior - not a balloon popup bug!
