- Test thoroughly 
- ONLY then make milestone backup

#### 4. FOCUS ON QUALITY ARCHITECTURE
```javascript
// Always prioritize:
Component-based architecture;      // Maintainable
Proper error handling;             // Reliable

2. Implement chosen solution COMPLETELY
3. Test thoroughly from working/
4. Document what works

#### Phase 3: Success Backup (When working)
1. Copy working/ to v1-[solution-name]/
